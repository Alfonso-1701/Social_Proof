## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I understood using rem for resizing but after having tested it with some elements on the page, I was able to see how setting somethings scale hard coded with pixels, doesn't allow for different users needs and preferences. 

### Continued development

Looking to continue my development with handling flex and grid automatically and as if it were like riding a bike.
